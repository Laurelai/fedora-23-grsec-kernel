# fedora-23-grsec-kernel
grsecurity patched kernel for fedora 23


See fedora 20 grsec kernel for references.

These files should be all you need for that kernel version.

Replace native files with ones provided.

use diff to see what was changed, note the grsecurity patch had to be altered to place an email at the top or rombuild puked, so i copied and pasted one from another patch. This works but eventually ill write something else.
